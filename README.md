# pattern-recognition
Repository containing the Pattern Recognition algorithms implemented to the UFC discipline TIP8311

The rules to work with this repository are the following:
* The programming language used is going to be python

* At the master branch, only finished algorithms are allowed and they **must be** on *.py* files

* Jupyter Notebooks are allowed **ONLY** to present examples using the algorithms on the *.py* files

* Avoid to upload multiple datasets. Maybe 2 is enought to the examples

* The algorithms must be developed at branch **develop**. Jupyter Notebooks can be used there, but never merged at master branch.

* Take care with the **.gitignore** file. It is configured to Python, MacOS, Linux and Jupyter. If another thing will be used, please update it!
